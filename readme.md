### My project's structure
Firstly, I generate the form  and the list header in html, and then I styled them in with css. Secondly, I grabed form, ul, and button element and div container from the html. Thirdly, I created an array of object to and put them in the list so that the user already have them before they add theirs. Forth, I created function which handled the submit form, and then I grabed the input field inside that function in order to access thier values. I created an empty array and push the items in it. I created an html with a map method and then append it into the DOM. After that, I used the turnary method in the input field to enable the user to check or uncheck the checkbox. After that, I tried to delete the item from the list by clicking the deleted button. Lastly, I store the ietms in local storage.

## The thing which I would do if I had more time
First and fore most I would make my delete button work becaue I couldn't do it. Secondly, I would make my website look better. Also, I would refactor my code.

## Did I learn anything from it?

Yes, I did learn many thing such as using the custom event and store the thing in the storage local.

## The most challenging part

I think to delete the items was the most difficult part because I spent lots of my time to handle it but I couldn't still do it.

## Explanation about a topic
I would like to have more explanation about the find method. I would also like to know when we should use contains and when we should use matches in the event delegation.

## Comments
It was such a good project because there were lots challenges.
